# ButtonClickCounter
Task:
Using the project code attached. Modify and add two text boxes and a button. Allow to user to enter his/her full name (say, Michael Chu) in the first text box (font color black) and once the button is click, the reversed name (Chu, Michael) will automatically appear in the second textbox but the font color should change to red. Keep in your mind your code should work for ANY names based on users input. Please submit the entire project in one zipped file, as well as screenshot of how the code ran (before and after)
